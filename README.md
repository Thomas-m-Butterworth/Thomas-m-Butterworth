# Projects To-Do

A simple log of my dumb projects and my self-inflicted deadlines. All intended to be built in python using various different methods (Flask or Django for web-based projects, fancy learning it).

Project Name | Basic(ish) Description | Deadline
------------|-------------------|---------
**Ska Dating Sim** | A dating sim but you're recruiting for a ska band. | 10/10/21
**Butterzone** | Checks an [IMDB API](https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/movie-database-imdb-alternative/) for a film's star rating, returns whether or not it is in the "butterxone" (3.5-5.5 star rating, so bad it's good territory) with a short description of the plot. Remember to include a function that gives the user the option to choose between multiple options with the same name (e.g. remakes). Probably harder to do than I imagine, but it needs to be done. | 27/08/21
**Wrestling With Saddos Soundboard** | GUI Interface for sound cues of Wrestling With Saddos. Built in Tkinter. Similar to [Valhalla Soundboard](https://github.com/Thomas-m-Butterworth/valhalla_soundboard) in principle, but with a prettier interface that's easy to use for anyone teching the show. Include visual cues as hidden notes. |  01/09/21
**Soundboard Hub** | An app for mobile & desktop that hosts all the soundboards NMitB creates for shows. Library interface. | 20/09/21
[**NMitB Website**](https://thomas-m-butterworth.github.io/nomoneyinthebank_website/) | Fully functioning website for (No) Money in the Bank. HTML/CSS version built during the a 3 Week CodeNation Bootcamp. Now looking to improve upon it with a pythn based framework, and improve the overall look of it on all devices. Will use what I have an build it on a Django framework. More to test myself than anything. I'm most anxious about how to use the backend to input blog entries. Especially since I'm very well acquainted with Wordpress's interface. However, that's all part of the fun of forcing myself to do this. | 24/09/21
**Event Splash Page** | Ticket portal for NYE event | 01/11/21
[**Tasks for Thom**](https://github.com/Thomas-m-Butterworth/taskforthom) | Challenges set by [Nathan Lawrence](https://github.com/OhDearMoshe) to get me up to snuff | Ongoing
